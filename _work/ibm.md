excerpt: "Designed and deployed end-to-end AI solutions in NLP, computer vision, and LLMs, focusing on multimodal retrieval, anomaly detection, and HPC optimization."
---

* Implemented CPU multimodal retrieval (Grounding DINO, SBERT-Whisper) boosting speed 31% and recall to 83%.
* Orchestrated ancient map geocoding (68.6% acc) fusing GenAI correction and DBSCAN under custom validation.
* Bootstrapped a few-shot SBERT classifier achieving 73.4% accuracy via 10-shot LLM labeling; deployed via ONNX.
* Saved $1,000+/mo on 5M+ samples via a hybrid LLM/SBERT anomaly detection pipeline for sentiment analysis.
* Boosted summarization throughput 5x and cut waste 21.7% via parallelized LLM inference on A100 HPC.
