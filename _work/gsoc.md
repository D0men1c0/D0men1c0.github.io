* Used NLP models to analyze 500k Dark Web discussion points, identifying key topics and establishing 5 baseline categories. 
* Enhanced the model to interpret both images and text using BERT (170 topics) and CLIP/Vision Transformer (3 topics). 
* Validated clustering results with Machine Learning algorithms and LSTM, examining topic evolution and sentiment analysis over time. 
* Deployed 8 predictive models on Hugging Face to forecast trends and topics identified in the analysis.
