excerpt: "Thesis on the reproducibility of recommender systems, focusing on aligning evaluation metrics within the ClayRS open-source framework."
---

My final thesis focused on the critical issue of **reproducibility in recommender systems**. The core of the project was an in-depth study and alignment of evaluation metrics to ensure that experiments could be reliably replicated and compared.

This research was applied directly to **[ClayRS](https://github.com/swapUniba/ClayRS)**, an open-source Python framework designed specifically for the reproducible offline evaluation of recommender systems.

Key contributions of the thesis include:
* A thorough analysis of discrepancies in metric implementations between different popular frameworks, such as ClayRS and Elliot.
* The development and implementation of new features within ClayRS to import and directly compare recommendations from external frameworks.
* This work ultimately enhanced the framework's interoperability and provided a more robust methodology for conducting fair and reproducible experiments in the field.
