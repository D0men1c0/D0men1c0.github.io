This post introduces **Benchmark-Gemma-Models**, an open-source toolkit I developed to make evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) more accessible and meaningful.

The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional benchmarks, which often require significant computational resources. This framework is designed to be highly customizable and optimized to run efficiently even on low-resource hardware like Google Colab, allowing anyone to test models like Google's Gemma with their own data and metrics.

The ultimate aim is to give the community the tools to understand more deeply how these models work, promoting a more practical understanding of their true capabilities.
