I am a **Data Scientist** on a mission to use artificial intelligence to create solutions with **tangible, positive impact**. My passion lies at the intersection of **cutting-edge research** and **hands-on application**, where innovative ideas become robust and scalable systems.

At **IBM**, I work as a **Data Scientist AI Associate**, where I design and deploy **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and **LLM** solutions for enterprise clients. My work focuses on transforming massive datasets into actionable intelligence: I’ve engineered **end-to-end pipelines** that analyze **over 4 million conversations** using fine-tuned **BERT models**, and process **more than 10 million assets** with **OCR**, **NER**, and **LLMs**. I'm also deeply involved in **performance optimization**—reducing **ETL query times from 20 hours to 1 hour** using **Spark on IBM Cloud**, and initiating **HPC strategies** to accelerate processing tasks.

In parallel, I actively pursue research. I was a **Google Summer of Code 2024** contributor with **HumanAI**, where I explored the **evolution of language in Dark Web communities** (a **preprint** is coming soon). Outside of work, I dedicate my free time to **reproducing and extending recent NLP research papers**, often tweaking methodologies or applying them to novel contexts. This hobby helps me stay close to the academic frontier and continuously refine my understanding of language models and representation learning.

This blend of **industry experience** and **independent research** reflects my drive to bridge theory and practice. Academically, I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (110/110 with honors)** and I’m currently pursuing a **Master’s in Data Science**, which I balance with my full-time role at IBM.

My long-term goal is to pursue a **PhD in Natural Language Processing**, where I can deepen my expertise and contribute to solving complex language problems—**transforming research into real-world impact**.

Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I have a passion for **boxing**, which teaches discipline and mental resilience, and I enjoy the intellectual challenge of solving **Rubik’s cubes** and other **logic puzzles**.
