## About Me

I am an Applied Scientist on a mission to use artificial intelligence to create solutions with a tangible and positive impact on the world. My passion lies at the intersection of cutting-edge research and hands-on application, where innovative ideas are transformed into robust and scalable systems.

My experience spans both industry and academia. At **IBM**, as a Data Scientist AI Associate, I design and deploy NLP, Computer Vision, and LLM solutions for enterprise clients. In parallel, I pursue my passion for research: I was a **Google Summer of Code 2024** contributor with HumanAI, where I analyzed the evolution of language in Dark Web communities (a preprint on this research is coming soon).

This balance between theory and practice also defines my academic journey. After earning a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science** (110/110 with honors), I am now pursuing a **Master's degree in Data Science**. I tackle this challenge with great determination, balancing my demanding academic studies with my full-time role at IBM.

My goal is to continue on this path by pursuing a **PhD**. I aim to deepen my knowledge in Natural Language Processing and contribute to solving complex problems, turning research into real-world progress.
